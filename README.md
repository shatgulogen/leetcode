LeetCode Problem's Solutions

These are my solutions for LeetCode problems. The goal is to study everyday with a specific study plan and prepare myself for tech interviews to become an employee of a big tech company in near future. This list is only going to grow as I am working on it every single day nowadays, and I hope that this will be beneficial for your study as well if you have the same goal in mind. The list is also going to be well organized as I include more and more content day by day.

I picked Java for tackling the problems. You can also choose C++ or Python, whichever you are comfortable with for interviews at large companies.

Some of the books I use alongside and the ones that I recommend are:


**Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition (Java)**

**Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version)**


**Algorithms, 4th edition by Sedgewick and Wayne**





The key is to REPEAT!REPEAT!REPEAT!

Cheers and best of luck to you!

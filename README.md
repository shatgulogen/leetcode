LeetCode Problem's Solutions

These are my solutions for LeetCode problems. The goal is to study everyday with a specific study plan and prepare myself to become an employee of a big tech company in near future. This list is only going to grow as I am working on it every single day nowadays, and I hope that this will be beneficial for your study as well if you have the same goal in mind. 

I picked Java for tackling the problems. You can also choose C++ or Python, whichever you are comfortable with for interviews at large companies. 

Some of the books I use alongside and the ones that I recommend are:

Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition (Java)
Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version)
Algorithms, 4th edition by Sedgewick and Wayne


Cheers and best of luck to you!
